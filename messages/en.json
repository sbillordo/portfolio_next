      "p3": "That change and in the career I discovered that maths are fun when you applied in something real, like sales and costs. Anyway, I enjoyed Marketing a lot, and I think it gave me a business vision that if I studied other career would take me a lot more to develop.",

      "p4": "Always love technology, but at the same time had other strong interest that change at the time. Working in IT give me the same feeling as child when I discover some new and exciment topic that made me lose track of time and go all in learning more about that.",
      "p5": "In this path to learn new things and searching in Google or YouTube about my new passion, I see in retrospective that my only compass to guide me was 'this is cool, I wanna know more'.",
      "p6": "And that was all the justification that I need. That for me was 'cool'. Nowadays things does not change so much. Yes, I have more structure and develop frameworks to learn better. But what I more enjoy is working into something that I truly believe that's cool. Even though said in that way is not cool."
